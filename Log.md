### Thoughts: 
Python is pretty easy for beginners and I'm enjoying it very much!

Aside from that, I got started with my portfolio and I chose the palette for my website, I created the navbar and logo.

### Thoughts: 
Python's syntax is super easy, no need to define data types and such üëç CSS gets annoying sometimes ü•≤

I continued working on my portfolio and I made the home page. I thought I would be using more JavaScript but I'm mostly using CSS üòï


### Thoughts: 
No regrets in choosing Python, I'm enjoying it so far!

## Day 4

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 4 module. It covered lists and randomization. I've always had a hard time understanding arrays, lists and dictionaries. They get complex after scratching the surface. However, they are super important concepts in programming so I have to practice more!

I added an About Me page in my Portfolio but I don't have a clear idea of how I want my website to look so it's a little hard to write code üòÖ

### Thoughts: 
Got to practice lists more.

## Day 5

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 5 module. It was all about for loops, lists and randomization. It's getting hard but I'll just have to practice harder.

I changed up my the design of my Portfolio. Decided I didn't want to use multiple links. Rather, I want everything to be on one page with a smooth scrolling feature. It looks much more modern IMO.

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

### Link(s) To Work: 
- [Day5](https://github.com/rkhidesh/100-Days-Of-Code/blob/main/100%20Days/day5.py) A random password generator (this was a hard challenge and I couldn't tackle it by myself)

## Day 6

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 6 module. I learned about functions and while loops. There is a neat website called Reeborg's world and all the exercises were done there.

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

## Day 7

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 7 module. I created a Hangman game. It got quite complicated but nevertheless, it was fun.

## Day 8

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 8 module. It was all about paramaters and arguments. It's getting harder and harder which is expected of course and it's very easy to be discouraged but, I'm still showing up every day and putting in the effort which I'm sure won't go to waste.
