### Thoughts: 
Python is pretty easy for beginners and I'm enjoying it very much!

Aside from that, I got started with my portfolio and I chose the palette for my website, I created the navbar and logo.

### Thoughts: 
Python's syntax is super easy, no need to define data types and such üëç CSS gets annoying sometimes ü•≤

I continued working on my portfolio and I made the home page. I thought I would be using more JavaScript but I'm mostly using CSS üòï


### Thoughts: 
No regrets in choosing Python, I'm enjoying it so far!

## Day 4

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 4 module. It covered lists and randomization. I've always had a hard time understanding arrays, lists and dictionaries. They get complex after scratching the surface. However, they are super important concepts in programming so I have to practice more!

I added an About Me page in my Portfolio but I don't have a clear idea of how I want my website to look so it's a little hard to write code üòÖ

### Thoughts: 
Got to practice lists more.

## Day 5

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 5 module. It was all about for loops, lists and randomization. It's getting hard but I'll just have to practice harder.

I changed up my the design of my Portfolio. Decided I didn't want to use multiple links. Rather, I want everything to be on one page with a smooth scrolling feature. It looks much more modern IMO.

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

### Link(s) To Work: 
- [Day5](https://github.com/rkhidesh/100-Days-Of-Code/blob/main/100%20Days/day5.py) A random password generator (this was a hard challenge and I couldn't tackle it by myself)

## Day 6

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 6 module. I learned about functions and while loops. There is a neat website called Reeborg's world and all the exercises were done there.

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 7 module. I created a Hangman game. It got quite complicated but nevertheless, it was fun.


### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

## Day 8

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 8 module. It was all about paramaters and arguments. It's getting harder and harder which is expected of course and it's very easy to be discouraged but, I'm still showing up every day and putting in the effort which I'm sure won't go to waste.

I also worked on my portfolio. I did the Contact Page and all that's left is projects which I need to start working on üòÖ. I have a Mario and Princess Peach game which I want to make, so I'll start working on that.

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

I started doing the Mario and Princess Peach game. I already have some code written but I think I'll have to redo everything again.
I also continued watching the "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy. I'm on the API module.

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

## Day 10

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 10 module. It was about Functions with outputs.

I did CodeWars Python exercises.
I made a Flappy Bird Game by follwing a YouTube tutorial and added that to the Projects section in my portfolio. I should come up with my own projects instead of following YouTube tutorials but I don't yet have the skill set needed to accomplish that ‚òπÔ∏è
(That sounds like an excuse ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

## Day 11

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 11 module. The whole module was a Blackjack game.
I decided to make a calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also decided that I will not follow any tutorials and just use my brain to put in the effort and make the calculator work. Today I worked on the design part and tomorrow I'll start implementing JS for functionality.

## Day 12

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 12 module. I made a number guessing game and I did by myself! Although Angela's code was much more sophisticated, mine still worked! üòÑ
I started thinking about how I will go about making my caclulator. First thing is that I want the buttons to react to a user clicking and my friends helped me figure it out! Next step is to get the value of the buttons so I can perform the operations on them.

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

## Day 13

### Today's progress: 
Day 13 was all about debugging which I enjoyed actually. I used my brain and a debugger called Thonny to solve problems.

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.
