### Thoughts: 
Python is pretty easy for beginners, and I'm enjoying it very much!

### Link(s) To Work: 
- [Day1](https://github.com/rkhidesh/100-Days-Of-Code/blob/main/100%20Days/day1.py) A very small and simple Python project.

## Day 2

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 2 module, and I learned the data types, f strings and math operations (easy stuff). I completed 3 exercises that comes with the module:

Aside from that, I got started with my portfolio, and I chose the palette for my website, I created the navbar and logo.

### Thoughts: 
Python's syntax is super easy, no need to define data types and such üëç CSS gets annoying sometimes ü•≤

## Day 3

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 3 module. It covered if/else, elif and conditional statements. I completed exercises that came with the module:

I continued working on my portfolio, and I made the home page. I thought I would be using more JavaScript, but I'm mostly using CSS üòï


### Thoughts: 
No regrets in choosing Python, I'm enjoying it so far!

## Day 4

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 4 module. It covered lists and randomization. I've always had a hard time understanding arrays, lists and dictionaries. They get complex after scratching the surface. However, they are super important concepts in programming, so I have to practice more!
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102761065/166982795-582c29c0-bc52-4b97-8b02-4ab834ee25dc.png)

I added an About Me page in my Portfolio, but I don't have a clear idea of how I want my website to look, so it's a little hard to write code üòÖ

### Thoughts: 
Got to practice lists more.

### Link(s) To Work: 
- [Day4](https://github.com/rkhidesh/100-Days-Of-Code/blob/main/100%20Days/day4.py) A rock-paper-scissors game!

## Day 5

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 5 module. It was all about for loops, lists and randomization. It's getting hard, but I'll just have to practice harder.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102761065/167181723-643903dc-83bc-4643-8746-9b8778cb943e.png)

I changed up my the design of my Portfolio. Decided I didn't want to use multiple links. Rather, I want everything to be on one page with a smooth scrolling feature. It looks much more modern IMO.

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

### Link(s) To Work: 
- [Day5](https://github.com/rkhidesh/100-Days-Of-Code/blob/main/100%20Days/day5.py) A random password generator (this was a hard challenge, and I couldn't tackle it by myself)

## Day 6

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 6 module. I learned about functions and while loops. There is a neat website called Reeborg's world and all the exercises were done there.

## Day 8

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 8 module. It was all about parameters and arguments. It's getting harder and harder which is expected of course, and it's very easy to be discouraged but, I'm still showing up every day and putting in the effort which I'm sure won't go to waste.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102761065/167524227-229977f7-720a-432c-ba23-52f44cccb1df.png)
I also worked on my portfolio. I did the Contact Page and all that's left is projects which I need to start working on üòÖ. I have a Mario and Princess Peach game which I want to make, so I'll start working on that.

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

I started doing the Mario and Princess Peach game. I already have some code written, but I think I'll have to redo everything again.
I also continued watching the "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy. I'm on the API module.

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

I did CodeWars Python exercises.
I made a Flappy Bird Game by following a YouTube tutorial and added that to the Projects' section in my portfolio. I should come up with my own projects instead of following YouTube tutorials, but I don't yet have the skill set needed to accomplish that ‚òπÔ∏è
(That sounds like an excuse ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

---
## Day 11

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 11 module. The whole module was a Blackjack game.
I decided to make a calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also decided that I will not follow any tutorials and just use my brain to put in the effort and make the calculator work. Today I worked on the design part and tomorrow I'll start implementing JS for functionality.

## Day 12

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 12 module. I made a number guessing game, and I did by myself! Although Angela's code was much more sophisticated, mine still worked! üòÑ
I started thinking about how I will go about making my calculator. First thing is that I want the buttons to react to a user clicking and my friends helped me figure it out! Next step is to get the value of the buttons, so I can perform the operations on them.

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

## Day 13

### Today's progress: 
Day 13 was all about debugging which I enjoyed, actually. I used my brain and a debugger called Thonny to solve problems.

## Day 14

### Today's progress: 
I created a game in Python called Higher or Lower. I'm moving on to the Intermediate part of this course. ü•≥
I tinkered with my JavaScript code and searched for ways to display the value of my buttons in the output of the calculator. I found some ways and that includes turning my buttons into inputs for it to work.

## Day 16

### Today's progress: 
I learned about classes, objects, attributes and methods in Python. It wasn't too hard since I already have prior knowledge of these concepts in C#. 
Finally, we have progress in my calculator project. I have displayed all the numbers in the output as well as added a clear button to clear the div. I can finally start working on the actual operations.

Practice, practice, practice.

## Day 18

### Today's progress: 
I dived deep into the turtle module in Python and created a spirograph.
I tinkered with my JS calculator, and I'm trying to find ways to perform operations on button values. I searched Stack Overflow found one question similar to mine, and I tried the solution code, but it just gave me a NaN output (which is better than nothing, but it's not what I want üòÖ). I was tempted to just copy and paste someone's code from YouTube, but I slapped myself and got back on track. I might post a question on Stack Overflow if I get super stuck.

Practice, practice, practice.

## Day 23

### Today's progress: 
Using the turtle module again, I created a turtle crossing game.

After research and posting on stackoverflow, I finally found the solution to my calculator. I didn't know that the join() method could be useful but after dissecting my code it makes sense. I added the project to my portfolio! Now, I have to start a new project.

## Day 34

### Today's progress: 
I combined API with GUI and upgraded the trivia quiz project I made days ago.
### Thoughts: 
The loops seem to break my Pomodoro code because the setInterval function is very sensitive. I'm trying to use an if else statement, but it still doesn't work.
