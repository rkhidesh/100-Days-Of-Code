### Thoughts: 
Python is pretty easy for beginners, and I'm enjoying it very much!

### Link(s) To Work: 
- [Day1](https://github.com/rkhidesh/100-Days-Of-Code/blob/main/100%20Days/day1.py) A very small and simple Python project.

Aside from that, I got started with my portfolio, and I chose the palette for my website, I created the navbar and logo.

### Thoughts: 
Python's syntax is super easy, no need to define data types and such üëç CSS gets annoying sometimes ü•≤

## Day 4

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 4 module. It covered lists and randomization. I've always had a hard time understanding arrays, lists and dictionaries. They get complex after scratching the surface. However, they are super important concepts in programming, so I have to practice more!
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102761065/166982795-582c29c0-bc52-4b97-8b02-4ab834ee25dc.png)

I added an About Me page in my Portfolio, but I don't have a clear idea of how I want my website to look, so it's a little hard to write code üòÖ

### Thoughts: 
Got to practice lists more.

### Link(s) To Work:

I changed up my the design of my Portfolio. Decided I didn't want to use multiple links. Rather, I want everything to be on one page with a smooth scrolling feature. It looks much more modern IMO.

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

## Day 8

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 8 module. It was all about parameters and arguments. It's getting harder and harder which is expected of course, and it's very easy to be discouraged but, I'm still showing up every day and putting in the effort which I'm sure won't go to waste.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102761065/167524227-229977f7-720a-432c-ba23-52f44cccb1df.png)
I also worked on my portfolio. I did the Contact Page and all that's left is projects which I need to start working on üòÖ. I have a Mario and Princess Peach game which I want to make, so I'll start working on that.

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

I did CodeWars Python exercises.
I made a Flappy Bird Game by following a YouTube tutorial and added that to the Projects' section in my portfolio. I should come up with my own projects instead of following YouTube tutorials, but I don't yet have the skill set needed to accomplish that ‚òπÔ∏è
(That sounds like an excuse ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

## Day 11

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 11 module. The whole module was a Blackjack game.
I decided to make a calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also decided that I will not follow any tutorials and just use my brain to put in the effort and make the calculator work. Today I worked on the design part and tomorrow I'll start implementing JS for functionality.

## Day 12

### Today's progress: 
I finished the Day 12 module. I made a number guessing game, and I did by myself! Although Angela's code was much more sophisticated, mine still worked! üòÑ
I started thinking about how I will go about making my calculator. First thing is that I want the buttons to react to a user clicking and my friends helped me figure it out! Next step is to get the value of the buttons, so I can perform the operations on them.

### Thoughts: 
Practice, practice, practice.

## Day 16

### Today's progress: 
I learned about classes, objects, attributes and methods in Python. It wasn't too hard since I already have prior knowledge of these concepts in C#. 
Finally, we have progress in my calculator project. I have displayed all the numbers in the output as well as added a clear button to clear the div. I can finally start working on the actual operations.

## Day 18

### Today's progress: 
I dived deep into the turtle module in Python and created a spirograph.
I tinkered with my JS calculator, and I'm trying to find ways to perform operations on button values. I searched Stack Overflow found one question similar to mine, and I tried the solution code, but it just gave me a NaN output (which is better than nothing, but it's not what I want üòÖ). I was tempted to just copy and paste someone's code from YouTube, but I slapped myself and got back on track. I might post a question on Stack Overflow if I get super stuck.

## Day 48

### Today's progress: 
Instead of Beautiful Soup, I learned how to use Selenium which is honestly much better than Beautiful Soup. Made a cookie clicker.

Made a Higher or Lower game using Flask.
I DID IT! I made my Trivia Game work!!!!! It worked! All by myself!! Now,all I need to do is improve user experience by disabling the buttons after the user answers all 10 questions, I need to print the final score and finally, I need to ask if they want to play again.

## Day 61

### Today's progress: 
I thought about my previous Pomodoro Timer and I realised that I needed to implement a countdown sound so that the user will know when the Study Time is over and Break Time is starting so that's what I did. I added audio at every switch.

## Day 63

### Today's progress: 
I decided to make my first Python Project and make a Discord Bot. A bot which'll play rock-paper-scissors. I started following a tutorial to learn how to use discord.py module. Right now, I made a bot which sends a random inspiration quote to a user. It's different and something fun.

## Day 69 - Day 74
## I skipped these days üò≠ I practiced some SQL and Python here and there but didn't do much unfortunately 
---
---
## Day 75

### Today's progress: 
Alright, so I decided to make a movie finder website. Idea came to me by observing that whenever I'm with my friends and we want to watch a movie, we never know what kind of movie we want to watch. Hence, my idea. You enter the genre of the movie you want to watch, and it'll generate 5 movies. If you click generate more, it'll generate 5 new movies.
I signed up for the Movie API and I got my API key. I used fetch in JS and it works. Now, onto the design of the website.

## Day 76

### Today's progress: 
Today, I worked on the design of my website. The first thing is the search button. I wanted it to look modern with smooth animations. That's what I worked on today.

## Day 77

### Today's progress: 
I started working on my logic. First, I want to generate all the genres of the random movies. So, I generated random movies using their IDs, and then made a for loop to loop through the genres.

## Day 78

### Today's progress: 
I discovered a bug. It showed me the genres in the console.log but it also throwed a 404 error. After a good while, I removed the = sign from my if statement and the 404 disappeared. However, now, at random times, the 404 appears again.

## Day 79

### Today's progress: 
I did some thinking and it seems that some random movie IDs don't exist. That's why the occasional 404 apppears. Someone suggested that I check if the code throws a 404 error, I should rerun the code.

## Day 80

### Today's progress: 
I wrote the if statement and now if there is a 404 code, it reruns so that's fixed. Next, I have to start accepting the user inputs and see if they match the genre.
