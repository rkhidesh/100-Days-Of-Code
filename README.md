Hello!

I've purchased a Udemy course called 100 Days of Code (Python). I would like to fully commit and study each module every day for 100 days. 
This will be my main focus but on the side, I'm planning to work on the JavaScript language and build some projects with it.

My main goal is get in the good habit of practicing coding everyday. The reason I signed up for this challenge is because motivation is the super highway to learning.

Good luck everyone and let's goooo!!! 

Rebecca
